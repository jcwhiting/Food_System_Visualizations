# Food_System_Visualizations

This is a repository of data visualizations examining the US food system from various perspectives. The first graphs, in the file First_Graphs.Rmd, look at number of farms in the US over time, and how numbers of farms in a state may or may not relate to food insecurity and access. The size of farm in each state is also examined. 

More visualizations will follow.
